SUMMARY="A native painting and image editing program"
DESCRIPTION="ArtPaint is a program for painting and image processing that \
won a Be's Masters Award in 1998. Since then (and after a rather long hiatus), \
ArtPaint development is very active again on Haiku.

ArtPaint features a comprehensive set of painting tools, dozens of add-ons and \
supports layers and custom brush settings."
